# taxon-symbology

I contributed to version 1.1.0, in which we added more legume genera and updated their colors for greater similarity between related taxa.

### Notes

There are now 24 legume genera, so we designed their base colors to be 15&deg; apart in hue space.

Non-legumes like _Quillaja_ get a shade of gray; darker gray means closer to legumes than lighter gray.
