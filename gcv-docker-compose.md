# gcv-docker-compose

The [macro-synteny-paf branch](https://github.com/legumeinfo/gcv-docker-compose/tree/macro-synteny-paf) is adapted to handle the new [macro_synteny_paf](macro-synteny-paf.md) microservice.
Feel free to delete this branch if you integrate this microservice a different way (independent of GCV, for example).

### To do

Once the macro_synteny_paf microservice is integrated, commit the microservices submodule as well.
